# 🌟 Liveliness Checks and Facial Recognition for Fraud Prevention with Virtual KYC Onboarding 🌟

## 📋 Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the security and efficiency of virtual Know Your Customer (KYC) onboarding processes using advanced facial recognition algorithms and liveliness checks. The system integrates various machine learning techniques to provide a robust security framework that significantly reduces the risk of impersonation and fraud.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **User Registration**: Allows users to input basic personal details to initiate the KYC process.
- 🆔 **ID Card Upload**: Users upload a picture of their ID card, and the system uses machine learning algorithms like OpenCV to detect and extract the face from the ID card.
- 🤖 **Liveliness Checks**: Users are required to write a random 4-digit OTP on a piece of paper and display it in front of the camera. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is used for character recognition to read the OTP.
- 🧑‍💻 **Face Matching**: The captured face is matched with the face extracted from the ID card using face-matching algorithms to ensure the user matches the ID card holder.
- 📲 **Automated Confirmation**: Users receive a confirmation message upon successful completion of the virtual KYC process.
- 📡 **Real-time Monitoring**: Administrators can track the progress of KYC onboarding and intervene if any anomalies or suspicious activities are detected.
- ⚖️ **Scalability and Flexibility**: The system is scalable and capable of handling large volumes of KYC requests efficiently.
